# Object Detection without OpenCV

This notebook demonstrates multidimensional motif search in python.

In this notebook we consider a simple case:

* We have a image of chickens
* Inside image of chickens theres a bug
* We want to find the coordinates of the bug

This notebook does not use OpenCV image detection, pattern matching. OpenCV is only used for i/o.
